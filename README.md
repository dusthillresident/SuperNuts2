# SuperNuts2
A simple PRNG written in scheme.

So far has been tested with the 'dieharder' test suite, and 'practrand'.
It seems to pass the 'dieharder' tests and is currently being tested by 'practrand' (generating 24 bit integer output to stdout)
The practrand tests are currently at 512GB passed with no anomalies, and 16 gigabytes passed with no anomalies for the same program but with the bits of the output flipped around. More testing is still needed though, I will update this document as the tests continue running.

It's also been visually inspected by plotting points in 3D space and plotting randomly coloured pixels to a 640x480 image. Screenshot are included in this repo. Take a look!

Thank you for checking this out. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions!
