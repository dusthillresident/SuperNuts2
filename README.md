A simple PRNG written in scheme. This is an experimental project made for educational purposes and just for fun too.

Inspired by this quote from 'teach yourself scheme in fixnum days' by Dorai Sitaram: https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-7.html#TAG:__tex2page_call_footnote_Temp_5

"Writing your own version of random in Scheme requires quite a bit of mathematical chops to get something acceptable. We wonâ€™t get into that here."

So I took on the challenge.
